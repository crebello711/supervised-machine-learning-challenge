# supervised-machine-learning-challenge

Background
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

You will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.


# Prior Prediction : 
I predict that logistic regression would perform better because in the context of low-dimensional data that we have here (i.e. when the number of covariates is small compared to the sample size), logistic regression is considered a standard approach for binary classification
